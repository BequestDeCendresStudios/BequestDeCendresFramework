The man in black is
here to stay, inside
weak wilting minds.
Here to stay, inside
the desert burial tomb.
Inside the crypt he
waits in shadows lurking.
Inside the crypt, he
wait to kill the Goddess
of cold wilting Pyramid.
The man in black is
here to stay, inside
weak wilting minds.
Here to stay, inside
the desert burial tomb.
Beyond the door
waiting, with a gun he
pounces and strikes.
And drinks of Goddess blood.
He drinks of Goddess blood.
All the moonlight hour.
