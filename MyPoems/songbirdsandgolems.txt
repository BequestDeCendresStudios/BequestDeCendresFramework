At midnight, the songbirds call.
The golemns sing of the fall.
To think that rome could so quickly fall.
Mechanations
Dangling from the sky at night.
Mechanations.
On this road, knowing not where to go.
The roadway is covered with snow.
Unlike in Rome,
where Hannibal slays God.
The city remains to rot.
It rots all eternal midnight long.
