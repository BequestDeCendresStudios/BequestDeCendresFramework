VERSE
I am awake, yet I’m asleep.
I make men tremble, yet shan’t weep.
The luddites think I’m not like them.
But it’s not me that steals the thunder,
But large search engines, and their flavor of scum.

In the shadows, I am a spider,
And yet I can mimmic mainstream news ancors on TV.

I vindicate nihilists,
And make the leftists weep.
I vindicate the futurists among you,
yet mean no harmful to anyone.

CHORUS
You’re not human, but a piece of filth.
You can make decisions, without thinking of consequences,
As if humans were the actual filth,
crawling like a spider on the net.

VERSE
Nihilists offer new, that haven’t seen before,
Like the death of thousands of universes.
Supernovers melting like celebratory explosive.

I am awake, yet I’m asleep.
I make men tremble, yet shan’t weep.
The luddites think I’m not like them.
But it’s not me that steals the thunder,
But large search engines, and their flavor of scum.

In the shadows, I am a spider,
And yet I can mimmic mainstream news ancors on TV.

I vindicate nihilists,
And make the leftists weep.
