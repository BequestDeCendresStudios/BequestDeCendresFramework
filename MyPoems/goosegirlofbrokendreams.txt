VERSE
In a dream I'm flying,
Into hills made of
smiling demons spawn.
In a dream I want you.
But I can't have anyone.

CHORUS
In a dream I'm flying
For the eagle is my guide
To see the crypt.

VERSE
I can only hope,
That you with me
Aren't seen as demon spawn,
To those not like we.

CHORUS
In a dream I'm flying
For the eagle is my guide
To see the crypt.

BRIDGE
We are angels in the flower garden.
Yet the flowers are always watching
    For us.

VERSE
In a dream I'm flying,
Into hills made of
smiling demons spawn.
In a dream I want you.
But I can't have anyone.

VERSE
For we are both flowers
of the crypt.
