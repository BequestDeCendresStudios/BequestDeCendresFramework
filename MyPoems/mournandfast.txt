My soul remains behind
To weep all night.
Take flight, ravens.

So long ago,
birds ruled purgatory, midnight
lasts three years.
For rest of all eternity
the sheep munch sunflower seeds,
while the widow blade drops.
So long ago.

My soul remains behind
To weep all night.
Take flight, ravens.

Angels weep their last,
weeping all night.
Take flight, ravens.

To mourn and fast.
