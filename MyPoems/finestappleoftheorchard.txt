VERSE
My girlfriend is
as sweet as cherry pie.
With bunny ears.

Pour cette pomme je veux
Un beze. Mie wifu du sange.

My girlfriend is
as sweet as cherry pie.
With bunny ears.

CHORUS
Not all is at it seems,
in the world of in between.
With reality tearing at the seams.
Demons shaped shaped like pyramids with eyes of hades.

VERSE
Come to my my sweet apple,
Finest fruit of the orchard.
Finest cherry in a fruit pie.

My girlfriend is
as sweet as cherry pie.

When she's not acting like a demon,
That wants to eat my soul.

CHORUS
Not all is at it seems,
in the world of in between.
With reality tearing at the seams.
Demons shaped shaped like pyramids with eyes of hades.

VERSE
But only you in wooden shoes,
And your bunny ears, with your pet goose,
Can put those demons in a noose.

My girlfriend is
as sweet as cherry pie.
With bunny ears.
