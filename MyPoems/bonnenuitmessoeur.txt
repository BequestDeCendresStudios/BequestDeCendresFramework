Yo da lay, yo da lay,
Me who!
Come to my crypt.

Someday one's
love shall never be had.
She would much rather, date some chad.

( Quack! Yo da lay, yo da lay, me who!)

And yet for some
faint memory lane she seeks us.

( Quack! Yo da lay, yo da lay, me who!)

On this road
To where I know not.
The daisies pushed up,
all turn to dust.

( Quack! Yo da lay, yo da lay, me who!)

Bonne nuit mes soeur.
Of lost love.

To think she would rather
date some cluster...

( Quack! )
( Quack! Yo da lay, yo da lay, me who!)
